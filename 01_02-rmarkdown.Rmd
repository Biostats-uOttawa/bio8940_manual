# Introduction to Rmarkdown

## Practical

We will create a new Rmarkdown document and edit it using basic `R` and `Rmarkdown` functions.

### Context

We will use the awesome `palmerpenguins` dataset `r emo::ji("penguin")` to explore and visualize data.

These data have been collected and shared by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pal.lternet.edu/).

The package was built by Drs Allison Horst and Alison Hill, check out the [official website](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).

The package `palmerpenguins` has two datasets: 

- `penguins_raw` has the raw data of penguins observations (see `?penguins_raw` for more info)
- `penguins` is a simplified version of the raw data (see `?penguins` for more info)

For this exercise, we're gonna use the `penguins` dataset.

```{r showdata-md}
library(palmerpenguins)
head(penguins)
```


### Questions

**1)** Install the package `palmerpenguins`.

```{r, eval = FALSE, class.source = "exer"}
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
```

**2)** 

- Create a new R Markdown document, name it and save it.
- Delete everything after line 12.
- Add a new section title, simple text and text in bold font.
- Compile ("Knit").

**3)**

- Add a chunk in which you load the `palmerpenguins`. The corresponding line of code should be hidden in the output.
- Load also the `tidyverse` suite of packages. Modify the defaults to suppress all messages.

<div class= "exer">
````markdown
`r ''````{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
```
````
</div>

**4)** Add another chunk in which you build a table with the 10 first rows of the dataset.

<div class= "exer">

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
penguins %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```
````
</div>

**5)** In a new section, display how many individuals, penguins species and islands we have in the dataset. This info should appear directly in the text, you need to use inline code `r emo::ji("smile")`. Calculate the mean of the (numeric) traits measured on the penguins.

<div class= "exer">

````markdown
## Numerical exploration

There are `r '\x60r nrow(penguins)\x60'` penguins in the dataset, and `r '\x60r length(unique(penguins$species))\x60'` different species.
The data were collected in `r '\x60r length(unique(penguins$island))\x60'` islands of the Palmer archipelago in Antarctica.

The mean of all traits that were measured on the penguins are:
`r ''````{r echo = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(across(where(is.numeric), mean, na.rm = TRUE))
```
````
</div>

**6)** In another section, entitled 'Graphical exploration', build a figure with 3 superimposed histograms, each one corresponding to the body mass of a species.

<div class= "exer">

````markdown
## Graphical exploration

A histogram of body mass per species:
`r ''````{r, fig.cap="Distribution of body mass by species of penguins"}
penguins %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = body_mass_g) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = species),
                 alpha = 0.5,
                 position = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Body mass (g)",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Penguin body mass")
```
````
</div>

**7)** In another section, entitled 'Linear regression', fit a model of bill length as a function of body size (flipper length), body mass and sex. Obtain the output and graphically evaluate the assumptions of the model.

<div class= "exer">

````markdown
## Linear regression

And here is a nice model with graphical output
`r ''````{r, fig.cap = "Checking assumptions of the model"}
m1 <- lm(bill_length_mm ~  flipper_length_mm + body_mass_g + sex, data = penguins)
summary(m1)
par(mfrow= c(2,2))
plot(m1)
```
````
</div>

**8)** Add references manually or using `citr` in `RStudio`.

  1. Pick a recent publication from the researcher who shared the data, Dr Kristen Gorman. Import this publication in your favorite references manager (we use Zotero, no hard feeling), and create a bibtex reference that you will add to to the file `mabiblio.bib`.
  2. Add `bibliography: mabiblio.bib` at the beginning of your R Markdown document (YAML).
  3. Cite the reference iin the text using either typing the reference manually or using `citr`. To use `citr`, instal  it first; if everything goes well, you should see it in the pulldown menu `Addins` `r emo::ji("muscle")`. Then simply use `Insert citations` in the pull-down menu `Addins`.
  4. Compile.

**9)** Change the default citation format (Chicago style) into the The American Naturalist format. It can be found here  <https://www.zotero.org/styles>. To do soo, add `csl: the-american-naturalist.csl` in the YAML.

**10)** Build your report in html, pdf and docx format. `r emo::ji("tada")`

### Examples

You can see an example of the [Rmarkdown](data/examples/rmarkdown_practical.Rmd) and [pdf](data/examples/rmarkdown_practical.pdf) output [here](data/examples)
```{r, out.width="20%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Happy coding"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/lter_penguins.png")
```
