# Generalized linear model, `glm`

## Lecture

```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Dream pet dragon"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fun_dragon.jpg")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
m1 <- glm(fish ~ french_captain, data = dads_joke, family = poisson)
```

### Distributions

- generalized poisson
- conway-maxwell poisson

#### censored distribution

#### zero-inflated / hurdle distribution
- zero-inflated/zero-truncated poisson
- censored poisson

#### zero-truncated distribution

#### zero-one-inflated distribution
